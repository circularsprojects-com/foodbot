## this source code (v2) is out of date, v3 will be published soon
# foodbot
a discord bot that posts food
# important information
- the emotes used for the bot (single positive, single negative, etc) are on my server, however the emote source is included in this repo
- the bot is set to post to a specific channel in my discord server
- the foodish api will work, however server.circularsprojects.com:3000 (or localhost) will not as i no longer host a copy of the api on my server.
- there's no package.json file
- you'll need to create a .env file with the token and guild id stuff
- slash commands will most likely not work
